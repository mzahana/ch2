Project files for MBZIRC2017 Challenge 2


To Mabrok:

ur5motion package is the same as in Husky PC, latest code.

The state_machine package includes vision class files. The main.cpp is the main file that manages everything. Modeswitch.cpp is the main subscriber and the main mode selector for the husky/ur5/vision.

Now, vision code and ur5 motion need to be integrated in the modeselect.cpp.

If not clear, I can start this state_machine later today.
